## Inspiration
Quarantine has forced many young people to get creative and find new hobbies, such as sewing. However, sewing has a steep learning curve and it's often difficult to find easy to sew patterns that fit. When attempting to draft your own custom pattern, the math became complex and annoying. The idea to automate this process created SewEasy.

## What it does
Our program outputs patterns for sewing and measurements based on the user inputted measurements. They can also select the specific garment they wish to sew. At the moment, users can choose between creating a tank top, pants, skirt, face mask or sweater. SewEasy will output a labelled diagram for users to follow. This allows people to easily recreate the pattern themselves with measurements tailored to fit themselves.  

## How we built it
We created SewEasy using React and Javascript. We also used css to style our pages and various packages to polish our project.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud to have learned more about effectively changing states in React. We are also proud to have learned and used javascript and have successfully built a working application. 

## What we learned
By creating SewEasy, we became more familiar with coding in React and using various packages with npm to create our final project. As well, we learned more about hosting options on GitHub pages or Heroku.

## What's next for SewEasy
In the future, we would like to add more and more patterns so people can have more options of what they can make. We also would allow users to download a printable version of the pattern.
